- **Creative:** AlgoMaths uses unique solutions simplify otherwise difficult concepts!
- **Useful:** The algorithms shown are all picked from contests such as Math Olympiad or MATHCOUNTS!
- **Fun:** Lastly, have fun with this project! You may implement it in yours as well!

## Usage

To run one of the algorithms, open up a terminal in the editor of your choice. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory you choose, then type `py main.py` to run the script. If this does not work, follow these steps:

- Check that you have installed the necessary files (not just main.py) onto your machine.
- Make sure that you have installed a python compiler.
- See if you are in the correct directory. Type `ls` or `dir`, and if you see the main.py file, you should be good to go!
