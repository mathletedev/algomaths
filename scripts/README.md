# Algorithms

This is a list of all the algorithms included in this project!

## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous pattern in mathematics. You start with 1 and 1, and then get the next number by adding the previous two together. For instance, the first few terms are:

`1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 35 ...`

## Graph Paths

This was inspired by a problem in a Math Olympiad test. Given a graph of `nodes` and `links`, how many different ways are there to travel from one point to another?

## Pascal's Triangle

Another famous mathematical concept, Pascal's Triangle is made by starting with a 1 at the very top of the triangle, then for each row, you add the two numbers above together to get the next one. It is similar to the Fibonacci sequence (which isn't a coincidence), but in the shape of a triangle. These are the first few rows:

```    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1```
